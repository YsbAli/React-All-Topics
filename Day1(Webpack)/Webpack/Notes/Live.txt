in js require in not a valid key word,,, it will throw error

require is node js term.

......video 32:00

npm install webpack


in package.json

to this.... "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" --->  "build": "webpack"

now run ----> npm run build .....
but webpack needs to run inside src folder so need to create a src folder

now need to install webpack-cli    -- Command Line Interface


now run ---> npm run build

it will create a dist folder , inside dist main.js


so dist refers to --> distribution


to running in background like nodemon we have 'webpack --watch'  here
